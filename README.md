# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Risk Predictor

A machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on a user's health metrics. This project combines data preprocessing, model training, and deployment in one end-to-end solution â€” designed for usability and clarity.

## ðŸ§  Model Pipeline

**Steps followed in `HeartDisease.ipynb`:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Distribution of features  
   - Class imbalance check  
   - Correlation heatmap

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Label Encoding: binary categorical features  
   - One-Hot Encoding: multi-class features  
   - Feature Scaling: `StandardScaler` for numerical consistency  
   - Save encoder & expected columns for deployment

3. **Model Training**  
   - Model: `LogisticRegression` (from scikit-learn)  
   - Train/test split: 80/20  
   - Accuracy score and confusion matrix evaluated  
   - Model saved using `joblib`

---

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface (Streamlit)

- UI built with Streamlit `st.form` for clean two-column layout  
- Inputs: sliders and dropdowns for user-friendly controls  
- Modern animated gradient background using custom CSS  
- Real-time risk prediction with clear result display (success/error blocks)

---

## âœ… Future Improvements

- Add multiple ML model options (KNN, SVM, XGBoost)
- Show confidence scores / probability
- Include data visualizations post prediction
- Store user history for longitudinal tracking
